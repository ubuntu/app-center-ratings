# Contributing to Ratings

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to Ratings and Ubuntu! Itâ€™s people like you that make it a reality for users in our community.

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing this project. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

We take our community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this project via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

* Search for existing Issues and PRs on this repository before creating your own.
* We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
* If you've never contributed before, see [this Ubuntu discourse post](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/contribute/26) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the software, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

* Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
* Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality.
* Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
* Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

> PRs will trigger unit and integration tests with and without race detection, linting and formatting validations, static and security checks, freshness of generated files verification. All the tests must pass before merging in main branch.

Once merged to the main branch, `po` files and any documentation change will be automatically updated. Those are thus not necessary in the pull request itself to minimize diff review.

## Contributing to the code

### Required dependencies

* rust and cargo >= 1.69
* protobuf-compiler >= 3.21
* docker >= 24.04
* docker-compose >= 2.18

### Setup on Ubuntu

```bash
# Install the Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y --profile minimal
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# Install build-time dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git gcc libssl-dev pkg-config protobuf-compiler

# Install Docker for running the OCI image and integration tests
sudo apt-get docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

# Alternatively, if you wish to install docker using the script provided by
# Docker themselves:
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o /tmp/get-docker.sh
sh /tmp/get-docker.sh
```

### Building and running the server

For local development there is a docker-compose file that can be used to run
the server alongside a local Postgres database for manual tesing and execution
of the integration test suite. The `Makefile` in the root of the repo has a
number of targets for running common actions within the project:

```bash
# To build the release artifact (located in ./target/release/ratings)
make build

# To start the local stack:
make up

# To stop the local stack
make down

# To run only the unit tests
make test

# To run only the integration tests (requires the local stack to be up)
make integration-test

# To run all tests (requires the local stack to be up)
make test-all
```

### About the testsuite

The project includes a comprehensive testsuite made of unit and integration
tests. All the tests must pass before the review is considered. If you have
troubles with the testsuite, feel free to mention it on your PR description.

Unit tests are located within the files containing the code they are testing.

Integration tests located in `./tests/` and run against the local docker-compose
stack (see the [Building and running the server](#building-and-running-the-server)
section above for details).

The test suite must pass before merging the PR to our main branch. Any new
feature, change or fix must be covered by corresponding tests.
